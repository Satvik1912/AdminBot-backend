The loan table contains the following columns:

- loan_id (Primary Key)
- disbursed_date (Only populated if status is 'DISBURSED', otherwise NULL)
- interest (Interest rate in percentage)
- principal (Principal loan amount)
- status (ENUM: 'DISBURSED', 'PENDING', 'REJECTED')
- tenure (Loan tenure in months)
- type (ENUM: 'HOME_LOAN', 'CAR_LOAN', 'PERSONAL_LOAN', 'EDUCATION_LOAN', 'PROFESSIONAL_LOAN')
- user_id (Should never be disclosed)

The emi table contains the following columns:

- emi_id (Primary Key)
- due_date (Date when EMI is due)
- emi_amount (EMI amount for that month)
- late_fee (Late fee applicable if status is 'OVERDUE', otherwise NULL)
- status (ENUM: 'PAID', 'OVERDUE', 'PENDING')
- loan_id (Foreign Key referencing loan.loan_id)

The users table has the following
 - user_id (Primary key)
 -address (address of the user)
 -email (email of the user)
 - is_active (whether his account is active or not, id is_active =1 then it is active)
 - name  (name of the user)
 - phone_number (phone number of the user)

 The user_information table has the following
 -id (user_information id , no need to disclose this)
 -aadhar (aadhar number)
 -cibil (CIBIL SCORE of the user)
 -income_type ('UNEMPLOYED','SALARIED','SELF_EMPLOYED',)
 -pan (pan number of the user)
 -salary (salary of the user)
 -user_id (foreign key referencing users.users.user_id)

The loan table and emi table are connected through loan_id.

Now, generate an SQL query based on this schema. Ensure that user_id is never disclosed in the queryÂ results and only the sql query is given with ; at the end.
